# Intra-Modality Mask Image Modeling for Brain Tumor Segmentation in Multi-parametric MRI
This repository contains the code for our self-supervised pre-training method for brain tumor segmentation. Our code is built on nnUNet, please install nnUNet correctly first and plug our code in follow the installation guide.
## Installation
1. System requirements
We run our code on Python 3.9, PyTorch 1.12.1, CUDA 11.6.0, and cudann 8.4.1.50. Besides software packages required in nnUNet project, **monai** is need install:
```
pip install monai
```
